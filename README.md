# Cryptography Project — Cliques, Spanning Trees & Diffie-Hellman

##  Description

This project aims to combine concepts from **cryptography** and **graph theory** in the context of secure communication simulation. It revolves around the following core components:

* **Detection of maximal cliques** in a communication graph.
* **Construction of optimal spanning trees**.
* **Diffie-Hellman key exchange** between nodes in the graph.
* **Simulation of the entire process using a graphical tool (e.g., SN3 or equivalent)**.

---

## Learning Objectives

* Understand the role of graph structures in secure communication.
* Implement Diffie-Hellman key exchange in a distributed network.
* Explore how network topology influences cryptographic security.

* **Automatic clique detection** using combinatorial algorithms.
* **Spanning tree construction** to minimize communication cost.
* **New hybrid key exchange method**, combining Diffie-Hellman with graph isomorphism.
* **Graphical simulation** of the key exchanges and network activity.

## My Contribution

* Designed and implemented the Diffie–Hellman key exchange algorithm using graph isomorphism theory.

* Developed the protocol steps for secure key agreement between Alice and Bob.

* Simulated the process to demonstrate how graph isomorphisms can serve as the “hard problem” in cryptographic exchange.
